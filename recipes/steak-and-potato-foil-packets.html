    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound small Yukon Gold potatoes, halved</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds sirloin steak, cut into bite-sized strips</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, sliced</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
      <li>1 carrot, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon steak seasoning, or as needed</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare an outdoor grill, preferably a charcoal grill, for medium-high
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in a microwave-safe dish and cook on high until they are
        tender with a bite, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide steak, potatoes, onions, red and green bell pepper, and carrots
        evenly onto 4 to 6 squares of aluminum foil. Add 1 tablespoon butter and
        a little fresh garlic to each pack; fold foil over the top to close each
        packet tightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place foil packs on the hot side of the grill. Cook for 5 minutes.
        Carefully open one foil pack to check for steak doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        If steak is not cooked to your taste after 5 minutes, continue to cook,
        checking for doneness every few minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center will read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for
        medium rare.
      </li>
    </ol>
