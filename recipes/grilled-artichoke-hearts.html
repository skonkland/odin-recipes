    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (28 ounce) cans medium whole artichoke hearts, drained</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Pat
        artichokes dry with a paper towel and thread onto 3 or 4 skewers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, granulated garlic, salt, and
        pepper in a large bowl. Brush artichokes with oil mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place skewers on the hot grate. Grill for 3 to 5 minutes, brushing with
        additional oil mixture occasionally, then turn over. Grill until
        artichokes are lightly charred, brushing occasionally with oil, another
        3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove artichokes from skewers and place into the large bowl; toss with
        remaining oil mixture and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
